# Order Management System - Technical Plan

## High-Level Summary
The Order Management System is designed to handle core functionalities related to managing customer orders. It includes features for order listing, order details, order creation, order modification, and order deletion. The system also incorporates aspects of customer relationship management by associating orders with specific customers and tracking customer order history. Additionally, the system handles financial tracking by recording the monetary amount of each order and maintaining financial transaction records.

## Epic 1: Order Management

### Feature 1: Order Listing
**Purpose:** Enable order administrators to retrieve and view all orders in the system for effective management and review.

**Implementation:**

### Feature 2: Order Details
**Purpose:** Allow customer service representatives to look up specific order details by ID to address customer inquiries accurately.

**Implementation:**
- Create an `OrderController` class with a `getOrderById` method to handle the API endpoint for retrieving order details by ID.

- Return appropriate responses based on the result of order deletion.

**Dependencies:**
- `Order` entity class representing the structure of an order.
- `OrderRepository` interface for database interactions.
- `OrderService` class for business logic and order deletion.

**Considerations:**

- Implement a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns (Controller, Service, Repository layers).
- Use Spring Data JPA for database interactions and object-relational mapping.
- Implement RESTful APIs for the endpoints mentioned in the user stories.
- Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to decouple the API payload from the internal entity representation.
- Implement proper exception handling and return meaningful error responses to the clients.
- Secure the APIs using authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
- Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the system.
- Use logging frameworks (e.g., SLF4J, Log4j) for effective logging and monitoring.
- Consider using caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Ehcache) to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
- Implement pagination, sorting, and filtering for API responses to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Follow Java coding conventions, best practices, and design patterns for maintainable and scalable code.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) for source code management and collaboration.
- Set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated builds and deployments.
- Monitor the system using tools like Prometheus and Grafana for performance and health monitoring.
- Conduct code reviews and perform regular security assessments to ensure code quality and security.
